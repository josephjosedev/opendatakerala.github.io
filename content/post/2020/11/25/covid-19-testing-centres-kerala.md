Open Data Kerala is happy to release the state's Covid-19 testing labs' dataset under an open license. All thought the data was available on the DHS Kerala website, and it was just a list of labs and their details in pdf format almost non-usable for any other purpose. A team, Open Data Kerala volunteers, sat and geocoded the labs' locations, classified it under government and private labs, and the type of test available. There are altogether 626 Labs available in Kerala for COVID-19 testing out of which 514 labs are giving Antigen test results, 42 are RT-PCR test, 50 are Truenat Test, 18 are Xpert, and 2 are CB NAAT. Government directly runs 26 Labs, and rest are privately owned. Ernakulam district has the highest number of testing centres â€“ 94 and Idukki district has the least number of testing centres - 14.
